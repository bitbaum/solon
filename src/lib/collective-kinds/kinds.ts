/**
 * The kinds of collective.
 *
 * A collective is a body of members: a household, a club, a Verein, a co-op,
 * a company, a town, a network state, a local fund. This list answers one
 * question — WHAT KIND OF BODY IS THIS — and nothing else. It does not say how
 * the body decides (Solon owns its governance profiles and keeps its own
 * "which profile fits this kind" table) and it does not say what the body may
 * do with money (OrangeCat owns its group features and keeps its own defaults
 * per kind). Both key their tables by these ids, and a test in each product
 * fails when a kind here has no row there.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A PACKAGE
 * Until 2026-09-28 the same list lived three times: OrangeCat's group labels,
 * Solon's governance profiles and Solon's marketing audiences — eight, five and
 * five entries, with no link between them, restated by hand in prompts,
 * comments and message files. Copies drift; imports cannot. Same cure as
 * @bitbaum/design-tokens, same rule: change it HERE, tag, bump, ship.
 *
 * ADDING A KIND is adding an entry. Every consumer derives forms, enums, DB
 * constraints and copy from the list, so a kind that exists here exists
 * everywhere — and a kind that needs a place cannot be founded without one.
