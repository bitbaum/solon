/**
 * What a collective legally is — as a fact with evidence, never as a mood.
 *
 * Three states, strictly ordered, each earned by a document a reader could
 * ask to see:
 *
 *   informal    — people acting together; no register knows them.
 *   registered  — a legal person: a register entry with a number.
 *   tax_exempt  — registered AND recognised as public-benefit by the tax
 *                 authority (Swiss: gemeinnützig, by cantonal decision).
 *
 * The state gates what a product may SAY. Only `tax_exempt` may mention
 * deductible gifts; `registered` may name the legal form; `informal` may do
 * neither. This is the same rule evig follows for its own Verein "in
 * Gründung": until recognition is real, no page promises a receipt.
