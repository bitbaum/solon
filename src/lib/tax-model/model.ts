/**
 * A tax formula as data.
 *
 * A country's income tax is a list of components. Each component reads a
 * tariff from one level of government and, optionally, multiplies it by the sum
 * of multipliers read from other levels. Which levels exist, what they are
 * called and which metric keys they publish belong to the country's pack in
 * Solon; this file knows none of them. A country whose tax has a different
 * shape is a different model, never a branch in the evaluator.
 *
 * Facts are the numbers for one period: a tariff or a multiplier, keyed by the
 * level and metric a component names. The caller resolves which facts are
 * current for the place and period; the evaluator only combines them.
